However, I would like to call attention to the treatment I received from your staff member called Cynthia. I did briefly mention it after my shift to one of the managers, however I could see that it was a very busy period, so I did not want to take too much of his time to explain the situation. I felt very victimised and bullied by Cynthia during my shift, from the beginning until the end. \\n\\n* One instance is when Cynthia informed me that there weren’t any drinking glasses at the terrace and followed this with a patronising comment along the lines of: “We do have customers you know?” I feel like this was quite unfair because nobody had yet told me that there weren’t any drinking glasses left. I did later start to get into the habit of looking to see which glasses or utensils were low on stock, however this being my first shift it did naturally take a bit of time for me to do this. This is just one of the many snarky comments Cynthia said to me throughout the shift, which made me feel extremely disheartened. I voiced this to her and said that I didn’t think the extra comments were necessary. \\n* This being my first shift, I made a few mistakes. I accidentally brought up unpolished glasses and asked Cynthia whether there was a possibility that I could polish them at the terrace. She replied with something like “No. You do know that this is a classy restaurant? We can’t polish upstairs. Why would you not polish it downstairs?” I deem this response to be unnecessarily depreciating because a simple comment like “No, please do it downstairs.” would have been enough for me to get the message. I feel like Cynthia did not try to understand or empathise with the fact that I was new and would naturally make a few mistakes. Her corrections were very critical in nature and greatly dispirited me. \\n* On another occasion during the shift, a worker voiced that the drinking glasses required a restock and Cynthia loudly said around me “Yeah, I’ve told her multiple times.” This made me feel extremely humiliated. \\n* Cynthia would also loudly sigh and roll her eyes if I sometimes did not initially comprehend the orders she was giving me or asked for her to repeat herself. I feel like she was very impatient with me and showed little support, especially considering that this was my first shift with Terra Terra. \\n* After telling Cynthia discretely that I thought she was being a bit rude to me, she came to the kitchen to speak to me. At this point I informed her that at the end of my shift I would speak with the manager regarding her behaviour towards me, thinking that perhaps this would allow her to reconsider her behaviour towards me for the rest of the evening. She replied in a threatening tone: “You do know that we give you ratings too?” and attempted to escalate the situation by trying to make me go to the manager there and then. She said something like “Let’s go to the manager then.” I did not want to go, firstly because I felt extremely intimidated, and most importantly because this would pause me from doing my work which is what I was hired for. After I said once “I do not wish to discuss this here.” as I considered it extremely unprofessional and classless to argue in front of the rest of the staff, she continued to try to pressure me to go to the manager with her. This made me feel threatened and very embarrassed because many members of the kitchen staff, who I did not personally know, were nearby.\\n* About half an hour later she said to me “When you want to speak to the manager let me know”. I replied saying that I would prefer to have a private conversation with the manager to which she replied something like “Why would you want to do that? You can say what you want to say around me.”  which I felt was disrespecting my decision. \\n\\nTo conclude, I feel like I couldn’t work and perform to the best of my ability by virtue of the constant discouragement, belittlement and discourteousness I was subject to by Cynthia. I felt extremely bullied and her behaviour put me under a lot more stress than what I was already under by being at a new workplace during the very busy and hectic Saturday evening. \\n\\nI wish to end this feedback on a positive note. It is important for me to stress that the rest of your staff were extremely positive, courteous and helpful, and their good nature has meant that this has otherwise been my favourite stint to date. I again thank you for having me at Terra Terra.\\n\\nKind regards, \\n\\nMaria-Magdalena Jurga'],\n",
